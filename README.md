# Analogic-Interface-
This project explores an analog interface system using integrated circuits. It covers instrumentation amplifiers, KHN filters, PGAs, and full-wave rectifiers, with schematics, calculations, and LTSpice simulations. A useful reference for analog circuit design and signal processing.
